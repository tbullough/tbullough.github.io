  content: <p>This section will include golf specific content designed to aid and improve your golf swing.<p>Firstly I’d like to give you an insight into my views on the golf swing. Simply put, I believe there are two main areas that every golfer should work on to improve the power and consistency of their swing:<p/><p>-	A strong stable base
-	A flexible and mobile upper body (thoracic spine).</p><p>How will these to facets help with your swing?</p><p>If you look at any throwing athletes- javelin throwers, shot putters, discuss throwers, baseball pitchers they all have extremely well developed lower bodies. This development of the lower body allows them to effectively rotate the upper body without compensating in the lower body, this in turn creates torque around the torso which when they uncoil allows them to apply tremendous force into the object they are throwing. A colleague of mine often uses the analogy ‘you can’t fire a cannon out of a canoe.” For me this sums up the above perfectly. How can you apply maximum force and generate club head speed if you don’t have a strong, stable base to start from. </p>That is the start point; from there the upper body then needs to be able to rotate effectively in order to create this torque in the torso. This is dependent on the tissue quality around the spine and the ability of the joints to rotate - both are very closely related.<p>If the muscles around the spine are tight and short then they will inhibit the ability of the joint and reduce its potential to rotate, flex, extend etc. Also, if the joints are unable to move through their full range then the muscles will become tighter and shorter again reducing the range of rotation that can be achieved. <p>How does this affect your golf swing? </p><p>If the upper body (thoracic spine) is unable to rotate the arms will come into play in order to generate extra movement (often perceived as extra turn) which can result in inconsistent planes and you will be left to rely on feel and timing which does not always produce the best results.</p> <p>In 1992 Jim McLean wrote an article that was published in Golf Magazine. His article proposed a theory that would later be termed the golf X-Factor. McLean referred to the difference of the degree of shoulder turn in relation to hips during the backswing. The greater the degree of difference combined with the ability to realign the hips and shoulder at impact would generate greater club head speed and in turn greater distance.</p><p>With this in mind much of the golf content will revolve around improving tissue quality and length, joint mobility and strengthening the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, traps). This will also help improve your posture and allow you to swing more efficiently and consistently.</p>
