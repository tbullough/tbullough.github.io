Much more importantly, Tom is personable, energetic and competitive. This means that players in his care are pushed, engaged and get results. He has built a rapport with all the players in his care and that leads to a healthy, hard working and successful relationship. My personal development is in no small part due to his industry and patience. I count him as  integral to my career and also a good friend."</p>
