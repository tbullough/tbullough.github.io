	<h2>About Tom Bullough</h2>

	<p>
		As a graduate from Sheffield Hallam University, Tom achieved his Honours Degree in Sports
		and Exercise Science and immediately pursued a career in Strength and Conditioning by 
		undertaking an Internship with Sale Sharks RFC. After a successful year working under the
		guidance of Nick Johnston, Tom was offered a full time position at Northampton Saints RFC.
		Within the Saints Performance Department Tom emerged as a pivotal member of the team and 
		developed into an excellent and accomplished practitioner. A dedicated and perceptive Stength 
		and Conditioning coach, Tom has the great ability to communicate with athletes of all levels 
		and gain the desired outcome - high performance every time!
	</p>

	<p>
		Toms appetite for learning and continued education has driven him to work with and receive 
		guidance from some of the best practitioners in the industry, namely Bill Knowles, Frans 
		Bosch and Eric Cressey to name a few.
	</p>

	<p>
		During his time working with the Saints Senior team, Toms main areas of specialism are 
		shoulder injury prevention strategies and Maximal Strength development for rugby. His
		influence in these areas with the Senior squad is unquestionable, osteopaths, coaches
		and players.
	</p>

	<p>
		As an accomplished golfer Tom has a handicap of +1 so has 'real world appreciation' of the 
		technical and physical needs of golf performance at the highest level. This website will be 
		a resource to help you improve your flexibility, mobility, strength and ultimately your 
		ability as a golfer, through specific strength and conditioning techniques.
